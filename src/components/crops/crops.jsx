    <h2>Seasonal Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Each crop has its own ideal growing season for maximum productivity. The app provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kharif Crops (June to October):</strong> Ideal for areas with high rainfall during the monsoon season. Recommended crops: Rice, maize, cotton, soybean, groundnut, and pulses like moong and urad.</li>
      <li><strong>Rabi Crops (November to April):</strong> Grown in cooler weather during the winter season. Recommended crops: Wheat, barley, mustard, peas, and chickpeas.</li>
      <li><strong>Zaid Crops (March to June):</strong> Cultivated in the short summer season between Rabi and Kharif. Recommended crops: Watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, and fodder crops.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate-Specific Recommendations:</strong> Crops for arid regions (e.g., Bajra, Jowar), humid climates (e.g., Banana, Sugarcane), and cold regions (e.g., Apple, Pear, Barley).</li>
      <li><strong>Crop Rotation and Intercropping Tips:</strong> Suggestions to maximize land productivity by alternating crops each season. Guidance on intercropping combinations like maize with beans or wheat with mustard to improve soil fertility and reduce pests.</li>
